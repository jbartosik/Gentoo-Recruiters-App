This will be web based application for Gentoo Recruiters team.

To start testing application you should:

1.Install gems. If you want only to run it install hobo gem. If you want to run
  tests you will need also shoulda and rspec. Install them how you would any
  other gem. You can have rake install it for you:

  rake gems:install

  or install them manually:

  gem install hobo rspec shoulda

  For detailed instructions see:

  http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/10#page33


2.Install git.
3.Get sources

  git clone git://git.overlays.gentoo.org/proj/recruiting-webapp.git

  to get accepted sources (recommended). Or if you want latest sources and
  don't mind fact that commit history will be rewritten a few times a day

  git clone git://github.com/ahenobarbi/Gentoo-Recruiters-App.git

4. Create config/database.yml file. The default, using SQLite v3:

  development:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/development.sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000
  test:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/test.sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000
  production:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/production.sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000

5. Initialize databases. Run

  rake db:create
  rake db:schema:load

  in directory with sources

6. (Optional) If you want some example data in you database before you start
  testing run

  rake db:seed

  and answer y to the question (remember, this removes all data from database).

7. (Optional) You can run some test I prepared

  rake spec
8. Start server

  ruby script/server

it will be listening for connections on port 3000.

Configuration

In config/config.yml you can set:
  seed:
    users_domain                - Domain for emails of users from default seed

There is example of this file in doc/config/config.yml. Remember to disable checks in cucumber and test environments or tests will fail.

Seed

If you want to edit seed remember you can use erb in db/fixtures/*.yml files.
